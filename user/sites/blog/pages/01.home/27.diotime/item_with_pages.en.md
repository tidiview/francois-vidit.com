!!! In Plato's “Banquet”, a few people gathered for a social gathering exchange views on the meaning of {r=fr/grc}love(Érôs){/r}.  
It is there that Socrates declares that as a young man, the "philosophy of Love" was taught to him by Diotime, priestess and prophet.  
Socrates asks Diotime several questions about love.
