|  |  | No god tends towards knowledge or desires to become a knowledgeable, because one is; |
|  |  | and if you are knowledgeable, you don't need to strive for knowledge. |
|  |  | Ignorants do not tend more towards knowledge or wish to become knowledgeable, |
|  |  | But that is precisely what is unfortunate about ignorance: while one is neither beautiful nor good nor knowledgeable, one believes one is sufficiently so. |
|  |  | No, one who does not imagine he is deprived of it does not want what he does not believe he should be provided with. |
|  | SOCRATE |  — Who then, Diotime, I asked, are those who tend towards knowledge, if they are neither knowledgeable people nor ignorant? ? |
|  |  |  |
|  | DIOTIME |  — Already, she replied, it is perfectly clear, even for a child, that these are the ones who are in between, and that Eros must be one of them. |
|  |  | It goes without saying that knowledge is one of the most beautiful things, and Eros is the love of beauty. |
|  |  | Consequently, Eros must necessarily tend towards knowledge, and, since he tends towards knowledge, he must hold the middle between the one who knows and the ignorant. |
|  |  | And what explains these traits to him is his origin: |
|  |  | because he was born of a knowledgeable and resourceful father and a mother without knowledge and resources. |
|  |  | Such is the nature of this demon, my dear Socrates. |
|  |  | But the idea you had of Eros, it's not surprising that you let yourself get caught up in it. |
|  |  | This idea of yours, insofar as what you say gives an indication of it, is that love is the beloved and not the lover. |
|  |  | That's why, I imagine, Eros seemed to you to be endowed with boundless beauty. |
|  |  | And in fact what attracts love is what is really beautiful, delicate, perfect, that is to say, what gives the greatest happiness. |
|  |  | But there is another nature of what loves, and I have explained to you what it is. <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="22px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 78 78" fill="lightgrey" opacity="1"><path d="M1.5 68.9991L20.9102 45.395c.88226-1.10283.88226-1.54397.88226-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76455-3.30857-2.8674-4.632L5.90836 23.9997 16.49877 3.0455 27.5273 18.48544c2.87047 3.97028 10.80793 15.88413 10.80793 19.19267 0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C17.1605 65.25246 14.95478 67.01703 7.01425 74.9545L1.5 68.99908zm38.16172 0L59.0719 45.395c.88228-1.10283.88228-1.54397.88228-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76457-3.30857-2.86742-4.632L44.07312 23.9997 54.6605 3.0455l11.03157 15.43992C68.55947 22.45572 76.5 34.36957 76.5 37.6781c0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C55.32526 65.25246 53.11957 67.01703 45.17904 74.9545l-5.51732-5.9554z"/></svg></span> |
