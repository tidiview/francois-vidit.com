The _altarpiece of Saint John L'Evangelist and Saint John Baptiste_ was probably commanded for the master altar.  
The framework is named Hans Memling and shows dates from 1479.  
The presence of Saint John-Baptiste on the central panel confirms this assumption since the master altar of an oratory was usually devoted to the patron saint.  
The Evangelist carries the calyx with the venomous serpent, the latter being a home to the fact that poisoning was sought.  
Saint Jean Baptiste is recognized to the accompanying lamb.  
He wears the robe in camel hair and shows something of his finger.  
This attitude relates to the gospel text « {r}behold&#160;the&#160;Lamb&#160;of&#160;God{/r:Ecce&#160;Agnus&#160;Dei} » by which John the Baptist announces the coming of Christ.  
These two characters together with two saints surround the sitting Virgin, throning in front of a brocable fabric and under a red velvet-coloured canopy.  
Two angels hold above the head a gold crown.  
The triangle layout of the three characters seated in the foreground forms the basis of a strictly symmetrical composition.  
The Child Jesus, sitting on the knees of the Virgin, passes a ring to the finger of Saint Catherine.  
This is why this triptych is very often called "the mystical marriage of Saint Catherine".  
It is Saint Catherine of Siena.  
The sword and the broken wheel are the attributes of Saint Catherine of Alexandria.  
The holy reading is Sainte Barbe that is recognized in turn.  
Two angelots hold company to the saints.  
The one on the left plays the portable organ, also called positive, that on the right holds a book that the Virgin through.  
The presence of all these saints surrounding the Virgin is rather reminiscent of the theme of « {r}Holy&#160;Conversation{/r:Sacra&#160;Conversazione} », a subject that Memling would appreciate because it would gave him the opportunity to develop a very balanced work.  

These are however the two saint John who appear to be the main characters, as demonstrated by the importance accorded to many, as demonstrated by the importance attached to the many details which, towards the viewer, must enlighten their biography.  
Scenes illustrating the main episodes of their lives are found on the columns capitals, in the landscapes and on the colets.  
Behind the columns, which form the vertical elements of the composition and delimit the foreground, we see a landscape.  
The many scenes, left of the background, tell the life and martyr of John the Baptist.  
The first two episodes of this cycle are illustrated on the capitals, above its head: "The Angel appears in Zaccharie" to announce the birth of a son, and the "Birth" itself.  
The story continues in zig-zag through the central panel and the left panel.  
One can see successively "Preaching in the desert", "John made prisoner" and "The body of John the Baptist burnt on order of Julian the Apostate".  
On the left side, in the background, "Baptism in the Jordan", and on the shore, "John the Baptist showing Christ to Andrew and John.  
On the left, in an interior, "Salome before Herod".  
In exchange for his dance, she will ask the head of John the Baptist.  
That is why the first plan is entirely occupied by the scene of martyr.  
The executionner puts his head in the dish without any visible emotion.  
Some spectators complete the circle.  
The two characters of the first plan are taken from a similar scene in Roger van der Weyden's Altarpiece de Saint John (Staatliche Museen, Berlin).  

The painter has used the same principle on the right to illustrate the life of John the Evangelist.  
On one of the capitals one can see "The resurrection of the Drusian woman" on the other "Saint John drinking the poisoned cup".  
In the background we see "the apostle plunged into boiling oil".  

We will also see how "he baptise the philosopher Craton" and, at the right extreme, how "we lead him to the boat" which will take him to the island of Patmos.  
The right panel is entirely devoted to the visions of Revelation.  
The evangelist, sitting on a rock, circular in the middle of the Aegean sea, writes in the tale of Revelation concerning the end of the time, illustrated in the upper left angle.  
The scene takes place in the clouds and is framed by a rainbow.  
Other events at the end of the world will take place on earth.  
The most important character of this event is "God" sitting on a throne.  
He holds a scepter and, lays on his knees, the book with the seven seals.  
The Lamb rises and, when it will break the seals, earthquakes will occur on the earth.  
Around the throne are seated the "Living", represented by the Evangelists symbols: the winged lion (Mark), the winged bull (Luke), the human figure (Mathiew) and the eagle (John).  
The "Elders" sit around the throne.  
They play different musical instruments.  
In the bottom is standing an angel.  
At his feet, another angel kneels in front of the altar of incenses.  
In the middle of the earth scenes, we first see the "four knights of Revelation".  
The black horse rider personifies the "famine", the one that climbs the greenish horse is called "the Plague". 
It is pursued by the Hades.  
"Men get refuge in the caves".  
On top of the monster, one can see on an island fire mixed with hail.  
"A burning mass", like a mountain, destroys ships.   
The wound of the "giant grasshoppers" is represented on the right, the "horses who comissent the fire" assail the beach.  
"The mighty Angel" with feet like columns of fire, touches the rainbow of the head.  
Higher, in a medallion, the "woman", dressed of the sun, the moon under her feet.  
A seven-head dragon tries to remove his child.  

Memling describes these dramatic events with a wealth of colours.  
Some elements that are reflected in water betray his taste for the analysis of natural phenomenas.  
Players who get smaller as long as they get closer to the back are the result of the "linear perspective" used here.  
Let's cite an interesting detail in the center panel, right of the drapery of honor, in the top.  
This is a view of the Crane Square on which the wooden Crane was located.  
This scene relates to the history of the hospital.  
Bordeaux wine barrels were unloaded here.  
We see little characters, brothers, measuring the barrels.  
The right to gauge was a communal charge consisting of measuring and probing the imported wine.  
In 1300, this burden was entrusted to the hospital and was for centuries an important source of income.

The edges of the shutters decorate the portraits of the kneeling and accompanied donors of their patron saints. 
They are represented in shallow niches.  
They were all identified.  
We recognize, from left to Right, Jacob of Keuninc and Saint James the Great of Compostela dressed as a pilgrim, Saint Anthony Abbot, which is recognized by his crozier and piglet, patron of Antoine Seghers, master of the hospital.  
Agnès Casembrood is hung in front of Saint Agnes, that can be recongnized by the lamb.  
Saint Clare, that holds the censer, protects Sister Claire Van Hulsen.  

When on Sundays and days of celebration, and during religious offices, the polyptich was opened, the sick could see this group of saints, these idealised characters, immobiles in an atmosphere of calm and without passion, a world that contained the promise of hereafter, in which the suffering and the tried of the earth would be rewarded.  

The triptych was probably commanded before 1475, since it was in that year that Antoine Seghers died.  
It was placed above the master altar in 1479.  
It was taken away from the church in the seventeenth century to take place in 1637 at the Baroque altar.
