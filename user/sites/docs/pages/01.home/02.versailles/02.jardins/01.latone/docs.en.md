!! As [Louis XIV][1] wrote in his “{r}Way&#160;to&#160;present&#160;the Gardens&#160;of&#160;Versailles{/r:Manière&#160;de&#160;montrer&#160;les&#160;jardins&#160;de&#160;Versailles}”, from the palace western facade, along its central axe, after the {r}the&#160;Ornamental&#160;Pool{/r:le&#160;Parterre&#160;d'&#160;Eau}, enjoying the opening change of the horizon line, {r}the&#160;Latona&#160;Fountain&#160;and&#160;Parterre{/r:le&#160;Bassin&#160;et&#160;le&#160;Parterre&#160;de&#160;Latone} appears。  
!! Here is a fountain inspired by the opposition between [Latona][2], that was to give birth, despite the persecution of goddess [Juno][3], to twins, [Apollo][4], god of the sun, [Diana][5], goddess of the moon and the [Lycian][6] peasants.  
!! With the text written by [Ovid][7] in “[The Metamorphoses][8]”, this opposition should probably comes closer to us.

<sup>333</sup>
There Latona, as she leaned  
against a palm-tree—and against the tree  
most sacred to Minerva, brought forth twins,  
although their harsh step-mother, Juno, strove  
to interfere.—And from the island forced  
to fly by jealous Juno, on her breast  
she bore her children, twin Divinities.  

At last, outwearied with the toil, and parched  
with thirst—long-wandering in those heated days  
over the arid land of Lycia, where  
was bred the dire Chimaera— at the time  
her parching breasts were drained, she saw this pool  
of crystal water, shimmering in the vale.  

Some countrymen were there to gather reeds,  
and useful osiers, and the bulrush, found  
with sedge in fenny pools. To them approached  
Latona, and she knelt upon the merge  
to cool her thirst, with some refreshing water.  
But those clowns forbade her and the goddess cried,  
as they so wickedly opposed her need:  

“Why do you so resist my bitter thirst?  
The use of water is the sacred right  
of all mankind, for Nature has not made  
the sun and air and water, for the sole  
estate of any creature; and to Her  
kind bounty I appeal, although of you  
I humbly beg the use of it. Not here  
do I intend to bathe my wearied limbs.  
I only wish to quench an urgent thirst,  
for, even as I speak, my cracking lips  
and mouth so parched, almost deny me words.  
A drink of water will be like a draught  
of nectar, giving life; and I shall owe  
to you the bounty and my life renewed.—  
ah, let these tender infants, whose weak arms  
implore you from my bosom, but incline  
your hearts to pity!” And just as she spoke,  
it chanced the children did stretch out their arms  
and who would not be touched to hear such words,  
as spoken by this goddess, and refuse?  

But still those clowns persisted in their wrong  
against the goddess; for they hindered her,  
and threatened with their foul, abusive tongues  
to frighten her away—and, worse than all,  
they even muddied with their hands and feet  
the clear pool; forcing the vile, slimy dregs  
up from the bottom, in a spiteful way,  
by jumping up and down.—Enraged at this,  
she felt no further thirst, nor would she deign  
to supplicate again; but, feeling all  
the outraged majesty of her high state,  
she raised her hands to Heaven, and exclaimed,  
“Forever may you live in that mud-pool!”  

The curse as soon as uttered took effect,  
and every one of them began to swim  
beneath the water, and to leap and plunge  
deep in the pool.—Now, up they raise their heads,  
now swim upon the surface, now they squat  
themselves around the marshy margent, now  
they plump again down to the chilly deeps.  
And, ever and again, with croaking throats,  
indulge offensive strife upon the banks,  
or even under water, boom abuse.  

Their ugly voices cause their bloated necks  
to puff out; and their widened jaws are made  
still wider in the venting of their spleen.  

Their backs, so closely fastened to their heads,  
make them appear as if their shrunken necks  
have been cut off. Their backbones are dark green;  
white are their bellies, now their largest part.—  

Forever since that time, the foolish frogs  
muddy their own pools, where they leap and dive.
