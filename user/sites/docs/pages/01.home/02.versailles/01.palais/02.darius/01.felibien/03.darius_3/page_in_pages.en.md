Nevertheless so Great a Variety of Things does not in the Least Hinder the Unity of the Subject; 
But on the Contrary all those Various Expressions, and all those Different Movements Contribute to Represent One Single Action, 
as if they were so many Lines Uniting themselves in their Center; 
there being Nothing in any of these Figures but what is Necessary, 
or that may be Left out, as Superflous or Unprofitable.

But it the Unity of the Action be Observ’d with so much Knowledge and Judgment, 
the Unity of the Light and the Unity of Colours are not Handled with Less Art and Beauty.  
And those Things Deserve so much the More to be Considered,  
that they are the Least Easie to be Represented, and such  as are most Pleasing to our Eyes.  
So that the Skilful herein do very well Know the Esteem we have for such Pictures, wherein we Observe a Good Union of Colours; 
and how Greatly we are Diverted, when we See that the Light and Shadows do therein Agreeably Deceive our Eyes.  
This Occasion’d the King to say in Considering this Work, when it was Brought into his Closet of Pictures, that it Maintained Amonst so many Valuable Pieces, a certain Brightness and Strength which Nothing was Capable of Eclipsing.

And Indeed it is not without Reason that we have so Great an Admiration for that Particular Part of Painting: 
For although Nature, which is the very Mistress of all the Painters, Informs them dayly in what Manner the Light Spreads it self, as a Liquor, over all the Bodies that its Enlightens; Yet when they come to the Performance, they Meet with so many Difficulties in Imitating Nature truly, that the Ablest among them are not always Successful.

However we See in this Picture, which I am now Describing, that all those Difficulties have been Overcome, 
and that Art herein Equals Nature. For the Figure which Represents ALEXANDER being the Principal of the Whole, it is Disposed in that very Place, where the Light Shines with the Greatest Force; 
And as to the Other Figures, they are Placed in that Manner, that the Light Coming to Spread it self afterwards to the Rest, According as they More or Less Distant.

But what Deserves Chiefly our Consideration, is that this Light Spreads it self with Softness and Union upon the Carnations; 
that it is Convey’d and Reflected with Grace and Liveliness upon Garments; 
and that it Strikes with Strength and Brightness upon the Armours and upon their Ornaments, Because they are of a more Solid Matter; 
and that Light does continually Produce Various Effects, not only upon those Matters which are Different, but beside upon such Figures as are so; such as the Superficies which are Flat, Convex, and Concave.

As to what Concerns the Unity of Colours, ‘tis a Thing very much to be Admired, to see how in this Cafe the Painter has made Use of Means altogether Unusual and Wonderful.   
For even as there is in this Picture a Point of Light, wherein all the Strength thereof Conflicts, which Spreads it self Afterwards upon all the Rest; 
in the Same Manner there is a Principal Colour, more Lively and Strong in one Particular Place; which Communicates it self afterwards to all the other Parts.  
And as the Unity of Action Proceeds from this, that all the Movements, though Various in themselves, have a Relation to one Single Subject; 
In Like manner all the Colours although Different and of several Natures, are so Justly Disposed One near unto Another, that they have Relation to the Principal and what is most Lively, which Governs the whole.

For if we Examine the Choice he has Made of them in the Draperies of this Figures,  we may Judge that he has not Work’d at Ramdom, neither has he Manag’d his Work Inconsiderably, and by a Meer Practise; But that he Understands Perfectly the Reasons of his Art, that he has from thence Drawn Infallible Rules, which Gives to his Pictures that Beauty and Excellency, which makes them Become so much Esteemed.

He Knows very well that there are Imperfects Lights in the Colours, and that all Colours are not really Different from another, but by the Greater or Lesser Quantity of Light which Each of them Possess.  
That as White Opens more the Sight, and Black Contrasts it; 
In like manner all the Other Colours Create Various Impression on the Sight, According as they Partake of a Greater or Lesser Portion of Light.  
So that other Painters have Term’d the Friendship of Colours, is Nothing else but a Perfect Agreement of the Equal or Unequal Parts which ours Eyes Meet with, in Passing from one Colour to Another.  
And what they call by the Name of Antipathy, is the Disproportion that there is between two Colours, which a Portion of Light so very Different and so Unequal, that it Produces, as it were a very Unpleasing Discord, and not much Unlike to that of False Tunes, which Proceeds from their Numbers being Irregular.  
For like as in Musick, the Agreeing of Sounds or that of that Voice Produce that Noble Harmony wherewith our Ears are Delighted; so the Agreement which is Found among the Colours, Begets that other Silent Harmony, wherewith our Eyes are so Pleasingly Charmed.  
Now the Painter has so wellKown the Agreement there is of the Colours one with another; the Other which they Keep Naturally among Themselves; their Strength and Weakness; and the Diminution of their Teints and Demy Teints, that he Makes therewith a most Admirable Concert.

And as on a Musical Instrument, we must bring the Strings though of an Unequal Bigness to a Perfect Unisson; So he has Found this so Excellent Art of Uniting together the Colours which are of an Unequal Strengh.  
For in Breaking or Mingling them together, he so Orders the Matter that being no longer Pure and Intire, it so Falls out that a Green Broken with Red Agrees with a Blew Mixed with White, 
Because Pure Blew which would Disagree with a Pure Green, 
by Reason of the Unequal Quantity of Light which Each of these Colours Possess, 
Finds it self as it were in a Perfect Union (if I may Term it) by the Means of the White and Red, which Modifie the Two other Colours, and Bring them to a Certain Degree of Strength which Produces their Union, 
And also that we may yet Pass more Gently from one Colour to another, he makes Use of the Reflections of all the Colours which Communicate their Lights the One to the Other.

Those who have Written on the Excellency of the Antient Painting, have Discours’d of the Conduct of Colours as a Rare Thing and Highly to be Commended.  
But to Judge Rightly of this Noble Conduct and the Effects of Colours, it is but to Consider how they are Judiciously Disposed in this Picture, that our Eye Passes Insensibly from the one to the other, without Finding any thing to Shock them, either by too much Disproportion or Stiffness.

For as Ephestion is the Figure which First Appears in the Disposition of this Work, which receives its Light Openly, and without any Reflection from the other Bodies, his Mantle is of a Scarlet Red, which has no Manner of Participation with the Neighbouring Colours.

As to the Mantle of ALEXANDER, it is Composed of Lake, Heightned with Yellow, not only to Represent a Robe of Purple Woven with Gold, which is a Clothing Suitable to the Dignity of a King, but also to Unite itself  both to the Scarlet Colour  wherewith Ephestion is Cloathed, and to the Mantle of the Queen Wife of Darius, which is another Kinf of Purple more upon Violet: 
For the Ancients had Several Sorts hereof, and the most Esteem’d was that, wherein the Stuffs were Dyed after they had Received a First Colouring of Scarlet in Grain.

This Upper Garment of the Queens, being as I have said, of a more Violet kind of Purple, and whose Heightnings Incline to a Blew, Agrees Extreamly well with the Drapery of the Nurse, which is of a Dirty Blew, and with the Robe of Statira, which is of Pale Blew Heightned with Gold.

And as I have Observed that there is a Principal Colour more Lively and Pure, which is that Red Colour wherewith Ephestion is Cloathed, 
so we may Observe that it Communicates it self Insensibily to all the Other Draperies, 
and seems likewise even to Revive it self (if I may Say) in the Mantle of the Youngest Daughter of Darius, to Unite it self with more Brightness to the Drapery of that Persian, with his Face to the Ground.

The Governess is Cloath’d with a Changeable Stuff between a Green and Red, 
and these two Colours do Very well Agree, not only with the Drapery of the Persian, and the Green Robe of that other Woman who is Behind the Governess; 
But likewise with the Drapery of the Young Princess, whose Robe Partakes of all the Colours which are About her, 
as well because that it is of a Changeable Stuff, as from the Reflections of the other Colours.

The Mantle of Sysigambis being a Cloath of Gold, Presides with Grace and Majesty over all the Other Draperies, 
and Unites it self with the Ornaments and Stuffs which are Heightnedwith Gold.  
And ‘tis this Fine Conduct of Colours, and his Judicious Diminnution of the Teints which Produce that Strength, Sweetness and Grace, which makes this Picture so much Esteem’d by all People.

Formerly those who were used to Represent Comedies, had a Custom of Covering the Fore Part of their Stages with Wool in order to Soften by that Means the Voice of the Chorus who Sang upon the Stage. 
And ALEXANDER having order’d a Place to Built, in the City of Pella for the Comedians, and Designing, to make it the more Beautiful and Rich, that the Fore Part of the Theater should be of a well Polish’d Brass; 
the Architect Diverted him from it, by Representing to him that the Voices of the Comedians would Appear less Fine and Pleasing to the Ear; Because Striking upon that Hard and Polish’d Matter, they would Become Piercing.

‘Tis the very Same thing in Painting, wherein too Great a Brightness Offends our Sight: 
For which Reason Appelles that Excellent Painter made Use of a Vernish wherewith he Covered his Works, to Lessen thereby the Force of his Colours.  
And we may Observe in this Picture after what Manner the Painter has Softned them, and has taken off some part of their Brightness and Natural Force, by that Means to Weaken them, and to Prevent them from Offending the Sight by too Piercing a Light.

But I Fear I should grow too Tedious, should I Insist any longer in Observing Every thing that is Considerable in this Work.  
I shall therefore Take the Liberty only of Saying farther, that it is the Design that is the Fondation of Painting, 
it is Managed with all the Art and all the Grace that can be Desired, not only in all the Figures in General, but even in the very Minutest Parts which Compose this Picture.  
For the Beauty of his Painting, and the Weakning of his Colours, do not Hinder us from Easily Discovering in what Manner the Outlines of every one of his Figures are Drawn, and the Features Express’d with so much Strength, Nearness, Judgment and Beauty, that it is scarce Possible to see any thing more Correct or Higher Finished.

And because there are Two Chief of Excellencies in this Picture; the One, the Strength and Expression of the Design; the Other, the Beauty and Skill in Colouring; 
We must Own that if it be so highly Valued by the Artists for the Greatness of the Design, it is no less to be Admir’d not less Pleasing to every One for the Beauty of the Colours.  
For they are to Wonderfully Fine in each Particular Subject;   
whether it be in the Men, or hte Women; whether Near, or at a Distance; in Places the most Enlightned, or in Those which are the Least; that Every thing there Appear True and Natural. 
Light and Darkness are Handled with so Elegant and Judicious a Contrivance, that there is Nothing but has some Roundness and Relief.  
For I may Say that those Lights and Shadows, those Teints and Demy Teints, which we Observe in Nature, are herein Imitated with so Wonderful an Art, that if we are not Intirely Deceived in Taking these Figures for Real Persons, nor as much Surprised as if the Thing was Actually a Doing, it is through Any of the Work.  
For Art is Carried as far as it could well Goes to Deceive our Sight.  
But as there are two Beams Issuing from our Eyes, which Seek to Embrace those Bodies, as are Painted only upon a Flat Superficies, Produce not upon our Sight a Sensation Equal to Those of Relief.

If the Painter has not been Able in this Occasion to Overcome that Obstacle, and to so Order it that Art should Equal Nature, he has Elsewhere Exceeded Nature, in what Relates to Proportion, Beauty and Grace.  
So one of the Ancients said, in Speaking of the most Able Painters of his Time, that they made Things which Surpass’d even Nature, in Drawing in their Picture more Perfect Beauties, than Those they ever Produc’d.

For Really, what Lovely Air and Noble Grace, has not this Great Painter of our Age Given to his Heroes?  
What Majesty, Greatness and Beauty has he not Express’d in the Faces, both of the Queens and Princesses?  
May we not Say that he has even Outdone the Historians, who has Spoken of the Wife of Darius, and his two Daughters, As the Most Beautiful Persons in the East?  
Doth the Carelessness and Simplicity of their Garments, Lessen in the least their Decency and Majesty?  
On the contrary, that Plainness in their Draperies gives a Luster to the Carnations; 
And he has no Cause to Fear a Reproach, 
Equal to that which a Great Painter Put upon one of his Disciples, who had Drawn Hellen Rich in Cloaths and Ornaments, but very Mean in Beauty; 
Since he has been more Careful, to makes these Princesses Appear Remarkable by their Beauty and Gratefullness, than by their Ornaments and Habits.

To Conclude, we may Observe this Subject is Treated with all the Grandeur, Majesty and Decorum it Ought to be; 
And ‘tis Enough to say, that it has had the Good Fortune to Please all those, Who Judges thereof.

The Appartment, or the Tent is of Purple Heightned with Gold; 
The Pavillon, Which is apart and Serves as an Antichamber, is Green; 
and the Galoon is of Gold.
