The Subject of this Picture is taken form that Passage of History, 
where ALEXANDER Attended by Ephestion, 
goes to Visit the Mother and Wife of Darius, 
after that Great and Memorable Battle 
wherein these Queens and the whole Royal Family remainded Prisoners in the Hands of the Conqueror.

The Painter could not have Exposed to the View of a Prince a more Famous and Celebrated Action, 
since History makes Mention of it as One of the most Glorious which ALEXANDER did ever Perform, 
in regard of the Clemency and Moderation which that Prince Shewed in that Occasion; 
For in Overcoming Himself, he Overcame, not Barbarous People, but the Conqueror of all Nations.

As the Disposition of a picture is the Part to be Chiefly Considered, 
I Shall Say that ALEXANDER being the Hero, 
the figure that represents him, 
is the Principal 
and the most Visible in the Work.  
And though Ephestion be Cloathed and Armed in the same Manner as ALEXANDER, 
Yet there is a Difference in the Matter, Ornaments and Richness of their Garments, in their Arms.  
The Head-Piece of ALEXANDER is of Gold and Shaddowed with large Plumes of Carnation; 
his Cuirass is of Silver Enrich’d with Grotesque Work of Gold ; 
his Mantle is of Carnation Colour Heightned with Gold, and Tyed upon the Shoulder with a Clasp of Diamond, made after the same Fashion as those Used by the Ancients Greeks and Romans.

But as to Ephestion, 
his Head-Piece and the Crest which makes the Ornaments thereof, 
are of the same Matter as that of ALEXANDER; 
his Cuirass to be of Polish’d Steel, Adorn’d with Branch’d Work of Gold; 
his Mantle is of Scarlet, 
Tyed likewise upon the Shoulder with a Clasp wherein is Set an Aggat which Represents the Figure of ALEXANDER 
which was then a Mark of the Illustrious Birth of those who Wore that Ornament.

The Skill of the Workman is to be Admired, 
in this that Designing to Draw this Interview of ALEXANDER and the Queens, 
he has Chosen the very Moment when Sysigambis, who was Mistaken in Applying herself to Ephestion, Throws herself at the Feet of ALEXANDER, and ask his pardon of the fame; 
For he Represents that Moment after so Elegant a Manner, 
that he Sheweth in is Picture an Infinite Number of Fine Expressions, 
which Render it Incomparable.

ALEXANDER Streches out one Hand to that Princess to Raise her, 
and with the other holds Ephestion by the Arm, 
and seems to tell Sysigambis, that she was not Mistaken, 
Because Ephestion was another ALEXANDER.

And as upon the Approach of the King, 
the Mother and Wife of Darius, the Princesses and their Daughters, and all their Retinue, 
came out of their Tent in order to meet the Monarch; 
this whole Court Appears under a Pavillion, which serves as a Vestibulium and Guard Room to the Appartment of these Ladies, 
which is Observable by a Shield Hunged up in the Pavillion, which the Painter hath there Drawn with that Design.

The Queen Wife of Darius, 
is in a Kneeling Posture behind Sysigambis; 
She has a Tiara about her Head, 
after the Fashion of the Queens of Persia; 
her Mantle is of Purple Edged with Scarlet; 
She holds up her Son, 
and behind her appear the Princess Statira and her Younger Sister.

Statira Cloathed with a White Robe, and a Mantle of a pale Blew Heightned with Gold.  
As for Younger Sister, her Robe of a Changeable Stuff, and her Mantle of a very Lively Carnation.

In the Retinue of these Princesses we see their Governess, Priests, Eunuchs, Moors, and several Women, 
all Cloathed after a Differrent Fashion; 
There are the Officiers and Ladies of the Royal Family.

Its Seems to me, 
‘twere Enought to Say that all these Figures are Exactly Disposed, and that they are Finished in all their Parts, whether in Relation to the Design, or in Regard of the Colouring.

But 
Since I Undertake to make a Description of that Admirable Painting, 
I Imagine that the Learned would not be Satisfied with so General an Account; 
As They Know all those Things which serve to bring a Work to Perfection, 
they would no Doubt find Fault, 
if I did not Enlarge more upon that is Excellent in this Picture: 
Yet I must Confess that being to give an Account thereof to Persons of so great an Insight, I can Scarce find Terms Proper enough to Describe well the Beauty thereof; 
and I am Fearful to Wrong by the Maners of my Words, 
those Noble Expressions which the Painter has so Elegantly Represented by the Force of his Genius.

Nevertheless ‘tis that very Beauty, and those Expressions which I Design most Particurlarly to take Notice of, in shewing how many Different Passions Appears in the Faces, and in the Movements of all the Figures Contained in this Picture. 
For if the Ancients have so much commanded that Picture, 
wherein Euphranor had so well Drawn ALEXANDER under the figure of Paris, 
that one may see is Face, Justice, Love and Valour, 
And that He Appeared at the same time, Judge of the three Goddesses, Lover of Hellen, and Conqueror of Achilles; 
We cannot have less Esteem for this Work, 
wherein we Observe so many Different Expressions, in the very same Figure.

The Painter was not Satisfied to Express in the Face of ALEXANDER, his Youth, Mildness of his Temper, Courage, and all those other Qualifications which History Informs us of that Great Prince, and of whom it gives a True Description; 
But besides in his Motions we Observe four Sorts of Different Actions.  
The Compassion for the Princesses Visibly Appears, both in his Looks and in his Behaviour; 
His Open’d Hand Shews his Clemency, & Perfectly Expresses the Favour he has for all that Court; 
His other Hand which he Lays on Ephestion, plainly shews that he is his Favourite, or rather another Himself; 
And his Left Leg which he Drawn Backwards, is a Token of the Civility which he Pays to these Princesses.  
The Painter has not Drawn him more Inclining, 
because he Represents him in that Moment that he Accosted these Ladies; 
that it was not in Life among the Greeks; 
And besides, that he could not Stoop very much, 
because that in the Last Battle he had received a Wound in his Tight.

As for Ephestion he Appears extraordinarily Surprised, 
not only that Sysigambis was Mistaken, and that ALEXANDER had Spoken so Obligingly to his Avantage; 
But also from the Beauty of the Princesses, 
upon whom we see his Eyes are Steadfastly Fixed.  
He is somewhat Taller and more Streight than ALEXANDER 
and yet these Two Figures are so well Ordered, 
and that of ALEXANDER Disposed so Noble and Agreeable a Manner, 
that one may easily see it Represents the King, Being the most Considerable of all the Figures.

We may hereby Judge of the Excellency of a Workman, 
when he Knows so well how to Dispose his Subject,   
that instead of Shewing the Natural Defects of the Person he Draws, 
he Dexterously Conceals them, 
without Lissening at the same time any thing of their True Likeness.  
‘Tis Remarkable of the most Famous Painters and Statuaries of Antiquity, that they always Represented Pericles with a Head-Piece, because his Head was ill Shapen; 

And when Apelles Drew the Picture of Antigonus, 
he Painted it Sideways, 
to Hide the Defect of that Prince, who had but one Eye.

For this Reason, 
as ALEXANDER naturally Inclined is Head, 
we see him here Drawn after so Dextrous a Manner, 
 that this very Action with the Painter hath Imitated, 
not only Appears no Defect, 
But on the Contrary, 
it seems as if it would have been a Fault in the Figures which Represents him, if that Action had been Omitted; 
Since it gives both much a Greater Grace, and Expression to it.

Sadness, Respect, and Humility could not be better Expressed than they are in the person of Sygisgambis.  
This Queen is portrated before ALEXANDER, 
where she Herself pays the Homage for the Whole Family; 
Her Eyes are Inclined towards the Ground, to Shew that She Relyes not on her Previous Fortune; 
her very Garments so Carely Spread Testifie her Humiliation. 
Nevertheless Tho’ Humble and Very Submissive, 
one may yet Observe in her a great deal of Majesty and Grandeur.
