But ‘tis in the Wife od Darius that Grief is the most Wonderful Express’d; 
We may see in her Eyes and thro’ her Whole Contenance, the Manifest Dissatisfaction she Receives from the Condition she is Reduced to.  
However, as she is Young and Beautiful, 
she Preserves in the midth of so much Grief & Dissatisfaction, a Decency & Majesty becoming a Great Queen.  
And we may also Discover in her Eyes and all the Features of her Face, the Hopes she has in the Clemency of so Generous a Conqueror.  
For though we may easily Perceive by the Motion she makes with her Left-Hand, that she would Execute Sisigambis in Mistaking Herself; 
We see likewise very well, that in Beholding ALEXANDER after that kind of Manner, She Endeavours even with her Looks which are the Interpreters of her Grief, to Affect the very Soul of that Prince with Compassion.  
She Holds up her Son, tho’ she Presents him not to the King, Looking on that Action has Unbecoming both the Son and Wife of Darius; 
But the Nurse of his Young Prince puts him into the Arms of the Queen his Mother, & in Beholding ALEXANDER, seems to Entreat him to take Pity on Him.  
We may Observe that this little Infant in the Innocency of his Age Stretches out his Arms to that Monarch, and would Caress him, as if he is Sued for hie Friendship: 
Which Occasion’d ALEXANDER to Say, in Talking to Ephestion, that he could Heartily Wished that Darius had had Something of the Temper of that Child.  
We may also take a Notice in this Picture, that neither the Novelty of the Action, nor the Looks & Arms of ALEXANDER, nor his face, with this Little Prince never saw, should in the least Surprize him; 
On the Contrary, endeavouring to Throw himself about his Neck, 
he seems besides that he would Present to him his Nurse whom he holds by her Coif; 
An Action Natural enough to Children, who will not Easily Part with those Persons who are commonly about them, and Whom they would have to Partake of everything they do.

As for Statira, this Princess is Weeping , and whollyGives herself up to Grief: 
Nevertheless we may see the Endeavours to Retrain herself, and to Conceal a Part of her Affliction; 
and that by trying to Smother her Sighings and Sobbings, her very Neck and Throat appear to be hereby Swelled.  
She Keeps her Eyes half Closed, 
as if she Endeavour’d to Escape the Sight of this Conquerour, and to Hide from herself the lamentable Condition she Finds herself in: 
For what other Thoughs Could so Great a Beauty & so Royal a Courage then have, Finding herself both a Captive and a Suppliant?  
‘Tis this Unfortunate Condition which makes this Princess appear Negligent both in her Cloaths and Head-Dress; 
the Hairs whereof in Tresses and Floating along her Neck, hinder not but that we may see the Beauty of her Breast.   
That Bathfullness so Becoming those of her Sex, and which the Ancients called the Vermillion of Virtue, is Admirably well Painted upon her Face; 
And her White and Delicate Complexio, as well as her Fair and Flowing Hair, Shew the Mildness of her Temper, which Appears likewise in her Actions.

As to her Younger Sister, Abundance of Things are to be Considered in her; 
Grief, Fear and Admiration produce Differents Effects in her Looks: 
For Grief Appears in her Eyes Still Wet with Tears; 
her Eye-Brows Advanced shex her Fear, 
and her Mouth Somewhat Opened and Drawn up express her Admiration.  
Her Colour and Motions shew plainly that she is of a more Quick and Lively Temper than Statira; 
for she is somewhat Brown and High Coloured; 
her hair is Black and Curled, and by her Contenance and the Disposition of her Body, one may Judge of the Activity of her Imagination, and the Uncertainty of her Thoughts.  
She would Joyn her Hands and yet she Does it not; 
She Bends her Body and Lifts up her Head; 
She had One Kneeon the Ground and the other Raised; 
There is even in her Cloaths the likeDisorder, which perfectly Shews she was not Acquainted with this sort of Duty, and that her Imagination is so Disturbed, that tho’ she would Perform Punctually what her Governess directs her, she Knows not even what she Does.

For behind Her Appears her Governess , who i with one Hand Shews her Sysigambis Prostrated at the Feet of ALEXANDER, and with the Other lets her knows that she Ought like that Queen, to Humble herself before the Conquerour.  
The Governess touches her only with the end of her Finger, which Shews the Respect she bears to her.  
The Air which Appears in the Face of that Lady, Shews plainly that she is a Person of Quality, and such as are Generally those Persons, who have the Care of Royal Children.

What there is yet Considerable in this Piece, is the Different Motions of so many Persons Attending these Princesses, 
Each Looking very earnestly on ALEXANDER in a Different Manner, according to the Capacity of their Understanding.

Near to the Governess I have spoken of, is a Persian Lady, who Appears Seiz’d with a Extreme Fear, and Great Apprehension.  
And a Sudden Fright causes the Blood to Retire to the Heart to Preserve it, because it is the Noblest Part of the Body, and by that means the other Members becomes Destitute thereof; We may observe this Lady to be  of a very Pale Complexion; that her Lips are without Colours; her Eye-Sunk and Obscure; her Eye-Brows Cast down and Contracted; 
She Lifts up her Shoulders, & Closes her Hands.  
Next to this Lady appears a Persian, 
who Prostrates himself to the very Ground, and according to the Custome of his Country, gives by this Action, a Sufficent Testimony of his Submission & Obedience: 
For the Consternation was so Great amongst those of that Court, that hearing nothing Talk’d of but Valour and Great Actions of ALEXANDER, they were not Acquainted as yet either with his Clemency or his Generosity.

That Man half-Naked, who Stretches out his Arm over the Princesses, is one of the Eunuques of the Queen Retinue, who makes Known to Sysigambis that she is Mistaken; 
and his Action Expresses Admirably well what his Intentions are. 
His Being halfNaked might be taken,for one of those Licences Allowed to Painters, to make that Knowledge appear which they have Muscles and Sinews, and to Express what is of most Difficulty in the Figure of the Humane Body, and of the greatest elegancy of the Art of Painting.  
But we Observe no such Licence in this Whole Work; 
it Takes its Beauty from the very Truth of the Subject its Represents, 
and we cannot Find the least Fault herein, Seeing that it was the Custom of that Nation to Quit their Habits and to Tear their very Garments, when they Found themselves under any Violent Sorrow and Affliction.  
And as there Attendants were in the most Profound Sadness, not only for the Captivity they found themselves Reduced to, but likewise because of the Belief that they had that Darius was really Dead, 
We must not therefore Wonder if that Eunuch appears more Particularly Affected with the Stroke of so Bad  a Fortune, since the Eunuchs being very Considerable Officers with the Kings of Persia, They had a Greater Share than Others in the Fortune of Darius.

That Court being Composed of Different Sexes as well as Different Nations, 
There are behind the Eunuch we have just Spoken of, Two Figures very Contrary in their Expressions; 
One Represents a Barbarian Slave, 
and the other a Grecian Woman; 
For we may Know the Country of the Latter by the Whiteness and the Freshness of her Colouring.  
Her Action and Looks Shews perfdectly that she Understands the Language of ALEXANDER; 
And because that in Remote Places we have always a Natural Inclination for those of our own Countrey, 
we may easily Perceive she has a Secret Joy in Seeing that Prince.  
That Slave who Stands before her is not in the same Circumstance, 
on the Contrary not Comprehending any thing of what the King says, 
he seems to be in Trouble about it, & to Inform himself therein by that Grecian Woman.  
And because this Sort of People, such as this Barbarian is Represented, have Commonly as Despicable and Mean Soul, they Fear every thing; 
and not being capable of nay Generous Thoughts, they Conceivethe Like Judgment of other; 
For this Reason we see that Base and Cowardly Fear Excellently well Express’d in the Person of this Slave, 
who Dares not even Hope for a favourable Usage from the Conquerour.  
As to the Grecian Woman, having no such Kind of Apprehension, she Hears and Beholds ALEXANDER with Pleasure; 
and instead of Answering this Barbarian, Signifies to him with her Finger that he should be Silent, and not Disturb her Thoughts.

Behind this Grecian Woman Appears an Egyptian Priest, Dress’d in his Hood, and in his Sacerdotal Garments; 
Who hardly Discerning ALEXANDER, because those who are before him, Lifts up his Head and Seems to Raise himself on his Toes the better to take Notice of him.  
And because these Priests were well ALEXANDER kill’d in the Languages, we may easily Perceive he Knows what ALEXANDER says, and that he Looks upon him in a most Particular Manner.

Near to this Priest there Appears an Egyptian Woman who Shew no Less Application for those Things she Sees: 
Her Eye Brows Raised, her Eyes, Mouth and her Hands Opened make the Force of her Attention plainly Appear; 
and as though not Understanding the Grrek Tongue, she yet Endeavours to Comprehend Something of what Passes.

A liettle Below her there is a Negro Woman, 
who not Seeing any thing from the Place she is in, Seems to Talk to the Egyptian; 
But her Thoughts are too much Taken up to Answer her.

There are other Figures seem, yet farther Under the Tent which serves as a Vestibulum, Among which that of a Blackamore Souldier who is altogether Terrified, because he Sees nothing of what is Done.

That Woman is hard by Ephestion, Appears greatly Surprized both at the Unexpected Coming of the Princes, & that Sysigambis was Mistaken, in taking Ephestion for the King.  
Affected on the Like Occasion, are Perfectly Well Express’d; 
not only on the Face of every one of those Figures, but moreover in all their Movements.  
And it is those Different Action, and that Variety of Expressions which Producethat Noble Contrast, which is to be Admired in this Picture.

For as there are in all Mankind two Sorts of Motions, 
that of the Soul and that of the Body; And that Commonly the Motion of the Body Pursues that of the Soul, 
Hereby we may Know that a Painter is Skilful in what Relates to the Passions, when he Knows how to Express Perfectly well these Differents Characters.

The School of Florence took such a Peculiar Care to Represent in their Pictures a Variety of Motions, and that they would not Allow of any Figures, of which the Attitudes were not Intirely Opposed; 
So that whensoever a Leg or an Arm was Stretching  Fowards, they would have it that the Contrary Arm or Leg should be Drawn Backwards.  
But to Speak Freely, ‘tis in that too Great Affection that Those of that School have Very much Erred; 
For in Imagining to make their Figures Appear more Lively and Active, they have in many Places Drawn a Thousand Extravagant Postures, not having had Discretion enough to Preserve what was Necessary and Decent.

The Roman School has been more Judicious, having Given Natural Motions to their Figures, and Agreeable also to the Different Subjects they have Undertaken to Represent; 
And even in this Work, I am Speaking of, there Appears a Singular Example of this so Noble a Conduct.

For ‘tis here to be Observed, that ALEXANDER Coming to Comfort the Family of Darius, which was in great Fear and in Disorder, there appears in all the Actions of that Prince and in those also of Ephestion, a certain Tranquility and Calmness, which Express nothing but a Peaceable and Indulgent Temper: 
And in the Court of the Queens we Perceive a Pertubation of Mind, and a Variety of Motions, which she Shew the Astonishment, Fear, Grief and all those other Passions where with those Persons are Affected.
