!!!! In the Salon de Famille de Louis-Philippe of the [Grand Trianon][1] in Versailles a painting from [René-Antoine Houasse][2], “Iris and Morpheus” can be seen.  
!!!! Based on a part of Book XI of [The Metamorphoses][3] written by [Ovid][4], it represents the particular moment when [Iris][5], messager of [Juno][6] enters the cave of [the Sleep][7] to order to him to make [Alcynoe][8] dream.

<sup>583</sup>
but Juno could not long accept as hers  
these supplications on behalf of one  
then dead; and that she might persuade Halcyone  
to turn her death-polluted hands away  
from hallowed altars, Juno said in haste,  
“O, Iris, best of all my messengers,  
go quickly to the dreadful court of Sleep,  
and in my name command him to despatch  
a dream in the shape of Ceyx, who is dead,  
and tell Halcyone the woeful truth.”  

So she commanded.—Iris instantly  
assumed a garment of a thousand tints;  
and as she marked the high skies with her arch,  
went swiftly thence as ordered, to the place  
where Sleep was then concealed beneath a rock.  

Near the Cimmerian Land there is a cave,  
with a long entrance, in a hallowed mountain,  
the home of slothful Sleep. To that dark cave  
the Sun, when rising or in middle skies,  
or setting, never can approach with light.  

There dense fogs, mingled with the dark, exhale  
darkness from the black soil—and all that place  
is shadowed in a deep mysterious gloom.  
No wakeful bird with visage crested high  
calls forth the morning's beauty in clear notes;  
nor do the watchful dogs, more watchful geese,  
<sup>600</sup> 
nor wild beasts, cattle, nor the waving trees,  
make sound or whisper; and the human voice  
is never heard there—silent Rest is there.  
But, from the bottom of a rock beneath,  
Lethean waters of a stream ooze forth,  
sounds of a rivulet, which trickle with  
soft murmuring amid the pebbles and  
invite soft sleep. Before the cavern doors  
most fertile poppies and a wealth of herbs  
bloom in abundance, from the juice of which  
the humid night-hours gather sleep and spread  
it over darkened Earth. No door is in  
that cavern-home and not a hinge's noise  
nor guarding porter's voice disturbs the calm.  

But in the middle is a resting-couch,  
raised high on night-black ebony and soft  
with feathered cushions, all jet black, concealed  
by a rich coverlet as dark as night,  
on which the god of sleep, dissolved in sloth  
lies with unmoving limbs. Around him there  
in all directions, unsubstantial dreams  
recline in imitation of all shapes—  
as many as the uncounted ears of corn  
at harvest—as the myriad leaves of trees—  
or tiny sand grains spread upon the shore.  
As soon as Iris entered that dread gloom,  
she pushed aside the visions in her way  
with her fair glowing hands; and instantly,  
that sacred cavern of the god of Sleep  
was all illuminated with the glow  
and splendor of her garment.—Out of himself  
the god with difficulty lifted up  
his lanquid eyes. From this small sign of life  
relapsing many times to languid sloth,  
while nodding, with his chin he struck his breast  
again and again. At last he roused himself  
from gloom and slumber; and, while raised upon  
his elbow, he enquired of Iris why  
she came to him.—He knew her by her name.  
She answered him, “O, Sleep, divine repose  
of all things! Gentlest of the deities!  
Peace to the troubled mind, from which you drive  
the cares of life, restorer of men's strength  
when wearied with the toils of day, command  
a vision that shall seem the actual form  
of royal Ceyx to visit Trachin famed  
for Hercules and tell Halcyone  
his death by shipwreck. It is Juno's wish.”  

<sup>620</sup>
Iris departed after this was said.  
For she no longer could endure the effect  
of slumber-vapor; and as soon as she  
knew sleep was creeping over her tired limbs  
she flew from there—and she departed by  
the rainbow, over which she came before. <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="22px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 78 78" fill="lightgrey" opacity="1"><path d="M1.5 68.9991L20.9102 45.395c.88226-1.10283.88226-1.54397.88226-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76455-3.30857-2.8674-4.632L5.90836 23.9997 16.49877 3.0455 27.5273 18.48544c2.87047 3.97028 10.80793 15.88413 10.80793 19.19267 0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C17.1605 65.25246 14.95478 67.01703 7.01425 74.9545L1.5 68.99908zm38.16172 0L59.0719 45.395c.88228-1.10283.88228-1.54397.88228-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76457-3.30857-2.86742-4.632L44.07312 23.9997 54.6605 3.0455l11.03157 15.43992C68.55947 22.45572 76.5 34.36957 76.5 37.6781c0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C55.32526 65.25246 53.11957 67.01703 45.17904 74.9545l-5.51732-5.9554z"/></svg></span>
