<sup>316</sup>
While these events according to the laws  
of destiny occurred, and while the child,  
the twice-born Bacchus, in his cradle lay,  
'Tis told that Jupiter, a careless hour,  
indulged too freely in the nectar cup;  
and having laid aside all weighty cares,  
jested with Juno as she idled by.  

<sup>320</sup>
Freely the god began; “Who doubts the truth?  
The female's pleasure is a great delight,  
much greater than the pleasure of a male.”  
Juno denied it; wherefore 'twas agreed  
to ask Tiresias to declare the truth,  
than whom none knew both male and female joys:  
for wandering in a green wood he had seen  
two serpents coupling; and he took his staff  
and sharply struck them, till they broke and fled.  
'Tis marvelous, that instant he became  
a woman from a man, and so remained  
while seven autumns passed. When eight were told,  
again he saw them in their former plight,  
and thus he spoke; “Since such a power was wrought,  
by one stroke of a staff my sex was changed—  
again I strike!” And even as he struck  
the same two snakes, his former sex returned;  
his manhood was restored.—  
as both agreed  
to choose him umpire of the sportive strife,  
he gave decision in support of Jove;  
from this the disappointment Juno felt  
surpassed all reason, and enraged, decreed  
eternal night should seal Tiresias' eyes.—  

<sup>337</sup>
immortal Deities may never turn  
decrees and deeds of other Gods to naught,  
but Jove, to recompense his loss of sight,  
endowed him with the gift of prophecy.
